HOW TO CREATE NEW ANGULAR PROJECT  
Step 1: Install Angular CLI  
If you havenâ€™t installed the Angular CLI yet, install it globally using npm (Node Package Manager):  

bash  
npm install -g @angular/cli  
To check if it's installed:  

bash  
Copy code  
ng version  
Step 2: Create a New Angular Project  
Open a terminal or command prompt.  

Run the following command:  

bash  
Copy code  
ng new employee-frontend  --no-standalone


Configuration prompts:  

Would you like to add Angular routing?  
Type y (yes) or n (no) depending on whether you want to include Angular's router.  
Choose a stylesheet format:  
Choose between CSS, SCSS, SASS, or LESS by typing the corresponding number.  
The CLI will create a new directory (my-angular-app) and scaffold the project structure.  

Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory  
bash  
Copy code  
cd my-angular-app  
Step 4: Serve the Application  
To run the project in development mode:  

bash  
Copy code  
ng serve  
The default development server runs at http://localhost:4200. Open this URL in your browser to see your Angular app.  

In terminal of the project, run the following to install bootstrap
npm install bootstrap --save

In your projects angular.json file modify the following 
            "styles": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
              "src/styles.css"
            ]

Generate the employee model class 
ng g class employee

Generate the employee-list component 

ng g c employee-list
